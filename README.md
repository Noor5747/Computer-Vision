The images.py script is a simple Python script that demonstrates how to load and display an image using the OpenCV library. OpenCV is a powerful library commonly used for computer vision tasks such as image processing and analysis.

Features:
Loads an image from a specified path on your local machine.
Displays the image in a separate window using OpenCV's cv2.imshow() function.
Waits for a key press before closing the image window, giving the user time to view the image.

Requirements:
To run the images.py script, you need the following installed:

1. Python (3.x)
2. OpenCV library for Python
